// Create a map using Leaflet that plots all the earthquakes from you data set based on long/lat
// Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher 
// magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
// HINT the depth of the earth can be found as the third coordinate for each earthquake.
// Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
// Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
